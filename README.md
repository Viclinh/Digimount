## Inspiration
Many organizations that have social impact operating models want to start up projects that generate good social impact returns but don't have funds for those projects. Further, a lot of  companies realize the increasing value that social responsibility actions and corporate giving practices can generate for their businesses. Today, aligning your business with a mission returns better financial performance. Despite this, the amount of the traditional forms of corporate giving such as corporate grants and sponsorships remains limited, mostly because of the high expenses and costs associated with these methods. Companies want to find alternative ways to diversify their charitable giving practices and mobilize their financial resources that are not used for granting.

Beside grants to nonprofits companies that are doing good, many companies lend money to for profit social ventures and revenue-generating nonprofits that can deliver social impacts. We develop an operating model that companies can give social impact loans to sustainable organizations that are solving social challenges.

## What it does
The app allows impacting organisations to submit loan applications in the following categories: education empowerment, environmental sustainability, diversity & inclusion, second chance employment, racial equality, and gender equality. The app also allows users to create XRP accounts, send funds, configure accounts to transfer funds, mint NFTs, transfer NFTs, and use a third party broker for NFT sale. 


## How we built it
We used XRP Ledger and Javascript to build functions such as creating XRP accounts, sending funds, configuring accounts to transfer funds, minting NFTs, transfer NFTs, and using a third party broker for NFT sale. We use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the website. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenged to come up with a good idea. We also had challenges to figure out how to use the XRP ledger and it took time to read through the documents. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to deploy our app with various functions using XRP Ledger and explained about our app.

## What we learned
We learn about XRP Ledger and how to develop functions such as reating XRP accounts, sending funds, configuring accounts to transfer funds, minting NFTs, transfer NFTs, and using a third party broker for NFT sale. 

## What's next for Digimount
We would like to include AI and chatbot to improve the customer services woro. We also want to add more functions using XRP Ledger.
